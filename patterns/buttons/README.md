The buttons use the primary colour and it's light and dark versions to add a pop of colour to the screen. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The standard button is the main button used throughout the website. It uses the primary colour of the website and the hover uses primary-dark to create contrast. Use the standard button for the cart in the nav, and the button in the banner.
- The light button uses the light version of the primary colour. Use the light button as the continue button or the add to cart button.
- The square button is used in only one place. It should only be used for the subscribe button in the sign up for newsletter section of the website. It is a square button to match the input box beside it.
